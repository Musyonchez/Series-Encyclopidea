			Seeking other Mandalorians to help him reunite the Child with its kind, the Mandalorian approaches gangster Gor Koresh, who attempts to kill him for his beskar armor but fails. Under interrogation, he reveals that a Mandalorian has been seen in the town of Mos Pelgo on Tatooine. Returning to Tatooine, the Mandalorian is reunited with mechanic Peli Motto. Although she thought that Mos Pelgo had been destroyed, her droid R5-D4 shows them an old map.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian finds Mos Pelgo, and confronts the town's marshal, Cobb Vanth, who is wearing dark green Mandalorian armor.[b] Vanth reveals that he is not a Mandalorian but bought the armor from Jawas then used it to fight off the Mining Collective that overtook the town after the collapse of the Empire. After Vanth and the Mandalorian witness a Greater Krayt Dragon eating the town's livestock, Vanth agrees to give up the armor, if the Mandalorian helps kill the dragon.

			<br>

			On the way to the dragon's lair, Vanth and the Mandalorian encounter a tribe of Tusken Raiders, who agree to help them kill the dragon. The Mandalorian volunteers the Mos Pelgo townspeople as reinforcements. Vanth and the Mandalorian convince the townsfolk to work with the Tuskens, who agree not to attack the town in exchange for the dragon's carcass.

			<br>

			Together, the Tuskens and the townsfolk bury explosives in front of the cave, planning to lure the dragon out and detonate them beneath its vulnerable belly. The dragon survives the explosion and spews acid at them, inflicting heavy casualties. The Mandalorian baits the dragon into swallowing him and a bantha loaded with explosives. He escapes from inside the dragon and detonates the explosives, successfully killing it.

			<br>

			The Tuskens butcher the carcass and recover a valuable pearl. Vanth relinquishes the armor as promised, and the Mandalorian leaves on friendly terms. Meanwhile, a heavily scarred figure watches from afar

			Returning from Mos Pelgo, the Mandalorian subdues bandits who attempt to capture the Child. His speeder bike destroyed, the Mandalorian walks back to Mos Eisley, finding Peli Motto playing cards with Dr. Mandible, who has information about Mandalorians.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian must transport a passenger, the Frog Lady, to an estuary moon called Trask where her husband will fertilize her eggs, and has information about other Mandalorians. Her spawn are fragile and must be transported at sub-light speeds, despite the risk of being attacked by pirates. The Child surreptitiously eats some of the eggs. They encounter a New Republic patrol and the Razor Crest is forced to flee to a nearby planet[a] and hide in an ice canyon. The ship crashes through the ice and is severely damaged. The Mandalorian wants to wait until morning to make repairs, due to the extreme cold.

			<br>

			The Frog Lady uses the severed head of the droid Q9-0 to translate and says they cannot wait, admonishing the Mandalorian for breaking his word, and he reluctantly begins repairs. Later they find the Frog Lady in a nearby hot water pool, bathing with her eggs. The Mandalorian warns her that it is not safe and collects the eggs. The Child explores the ice cave, finding another kind of egg, which he eats. Nearby eggs hatch, and soon the cave is filled with white spiders, of various sizes. They are chased by a cluster of spiders, and a giant spider attacks. The spiders surround them from all sides, but they make it to the ship's cockpit. A spider climbs onto the Child but the Frog Lady vaporizes it with a tiny blaster.

			<br>

			As they take-off, the giant spider attacks the ship, trapping them. They are saved by the X-wing pilots, who kill the spiders with blaster fire. There is an arrest warrant on the Mandalorian for freeing a dangerous prisoner.[b] They also note that the Mandalorian confined three other criminals and defended the prison guard, and so they are willing to overlook the incident. The Mandalorian asks for help, but they leave, warning that next time they might vaporize his ship. He finishes the repairs, and the severely damaged ship continues the journey. The passenger and the Mandalorian fall asleep; the Child has somehow sneaked another egg which he happily gulps down.

			The Razor Crest, severely damaged,[a] crash lands on the moon of Trask. The Frog Lady is reunited with her husband, who directs The Mandalorian to an inn, where he learns three Mandalorians have been seen, and the captain of a trawler of Quarren offers passage to find the Mandalorians.

			<br>

			Out at sea, the Captain shows them a Mamacore they are transporting. As he suddenly throws the Child's carrier into the beast's cage, the Mandalorian dives in after and is trapped inside. The captain promises to kill him for his armor. Mandalorians come to their rescue, killing the entire crew. The leader (Bo-Katan Kryze) and her teammates (Koska Reeves and Axe Woves) supposedly break taboo by taking off their helmets. The Mandalorian immediately distrusts them, but she explains her Mandalorian heritage and that he is a Child of the Watch,[b] a group consisting of zealots who follow "the (ancient) Way (of the Mandalore)", which mainstream Mandalorian society does not. The Mandalorian leaves, stubbornly refusing Bo-Katan's help.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian is attacked by the brother of the dead trawler captain. Again, Bo-Katan comes to his aid. She later explains that Imperial remnants still plunder Mandalore and her team is raiding cargo ships to steal weapons to retake their homeworld. She promises the information he needs in return for his help in their next raid. The Child stays with the Frog Lady.

			<br>

			The team make short work of the stormtroopers on board the freighter and take control of the cargo. Bo-Katan alters the mission, deciding to take the whole ship. She also reveals she seeks a Mandalorian relic which had been stolen from her: the Darksaber. The Mandalorian is reluctant. Bo-Katan mocks him saying, "This is the Way." The Captain alerts Moff Gideon, but it is too late for help. Gideon tells the Captain to sacrifice the ship to kill them all. The Mandalorian makes a dangerous charge at a group of stormtroopers, allowing the rest of group to take control of the ship in time. She presses the Captain to tell her the location of the Darksaber, but tells her she must already know and commits suicide.

			<br>

			Bo-Katan thanks the Mandalorian and invites him to join them in future missions, saying his bravery will be remembered. He declines, saying he must continue his own quest. While stating that the offer still stands, Bo-Katan directs him to the city of Calodan on the forest planet of Corvus, where he will find a Jedi called Ahsoka Tano.

			The Mandalorian and the Child head to Nevarro after the Mon Calamari repairs to the ship proved inadequate.[a] They reunite with Greef Karga and Cara Dune there, who have since turned the planet around. Cara has become the local marshal, while Greef has taken on the role of magistrate, assisted by the unnamed Mythrol.[b] In return for the repairs, The Mandalorian agrees to help destroy an old Imperial base on the other side of the planet. The Child is placed in a school, where he uses The Force to steal blue macaron treats from another student.

			<br>

			The base turns out to have more than just a skeleton crew and stormtroopers patrol the corridors. They deactivate the lava cooling system, so that the natural lava flows will destroy the base. During their escape, they find scientists and vats of what appear to be cloned bodies. The scientists attempt to destroy the evidence. Mythrol uncovers a recording from Dr. Pershing that reveals he had been transfusing the blood of the Child, which has a high 'M-count', into test subjects. Stormtroopers soon swarm the team and they are forced to escape before the lava overheats and destroys the base.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian flies from the base to retrieve his ship, using his jetpack, whilst Karga, Dune, and Mythrol steal a stormtrooper transport. A chase ensues between the transport, driven by Dune, and speeder bikes manned by scout troopers. Greef Karga kills the last scout trooper, but TIE fighters launched from the base chase after them, disabling the transport's cannon. The base soon explodes due to the overheating of the lava. As the TIE fighters close in on Dune, Karga and Mythrol, the Razor Crest appears and destroys the Imperials.

			<br>

			With his ship repaired and Nevarro secured, Mando heads for Corvus to track down Ahsoka Tano. The New Republic visits Karga to investigate the incident, with Captain Carson Teva noting "something is brewing and we need to put a stop to it". Teva speaks with Dune and tries asking for her help in fighting remnants of the Empire. When Alderaan, Dune's homeworld, is mentioned, she tells Teva that she lost everything after its destruction.

			<br>

			An Imperial officer receives confirmation from one of the mechanics working for Greef Karga that a tracking beacon has been placed on the Razor Crest. Moff Gideon is informed and declares that they will be ready. The episode ends with Gideon looking over a line of Dark Troopers awaiting activation.

			On the forest planet of Corvus, Ahsoka Tano confronts Imperial Magistrate Morgan Elsbeth, ruler of the city of Calodan, and her lieutenant Lang. Ahsoka gives Elsbeth one day to surrender and divulge her master's location.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian and "The Child" arrive at Calodan in search of Ahsoka, as directed by Bo-Katan Kryze. They are taken directly to Elsbeth, who offers the Mandalorian a beskar spear in exchange for killing Ahsoka.

			<br>

			The Mandalorian finds Ahsoka and she communicates with the Child using The Force. She learns that his name is Grogu and he was raised at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant. After the Jedi Order fell, Grogu was rescued and has been suppressing his powers to survive.

			<br>

			Ahsoka refuses to train Grogu, wary of the path he could take due to his attachment to the Mandalorian and the fear and anger inside him. The Mandalorian asks if she will help get Grogu training in exchange for him helping Ahsoka confront Elsbeth.

			<br>

			Ahsoka and the Mandalorian storm the city, killing all the guards and freeing the citizens. The Mandalorian kills Lang, while Ahsoka engages in a duel with Elsbeth. Ahsoka defeats Elsbeth and demands she divulge the location of her master, Grand Admiral Thrawn.

			<br>

			Ahsoka gives the beskar spear to the Mandalorian and directs him to the ruins of a Jedi temple on Tython, where Grogu may be able to contact another Jedi through the Force.

			The Mandalorian arrives with Grogu on Tython, and finds the ancient temple on top of a mountain. He seats Grogu at the center so that he may choose his path. Grogu meditates, and a protective Force field appears around him. Boba Fett arrives with the mercenary Fennec Shand, whose life he saved on Tatooine, and demands the return of his Mandalorian armor.[a] Following a tense confrontation, the Mandalorian agrees to trade the armor for the safety of Grogu. Two Imperial troop carriers arrive, carrying stormtroopers who attempt to capture Grogu. Honoring their agreement, Fett, Shand, and the Mandalorian join forces to fend off the advancing stormtroopers, inflicting heavy casualties. Boba Fett retrieves his armor and uses it to wipe out many stormtroopers before firing a rocket that destroys the fleeing troop ships. As the Force field surrounding him disappears, Grogu collapses from exhaustion.

			<br>

			Moff Gideon arrives in an Imperial light cruiser and destroys the Mandalorian's ship Razor Crest from high overhead. Gideon sends out four Dark Troopers, who capture Grogu and take him back to the cruiser. Fett and Shand agree to help the Mandalorian save Grogu to honor their debt. The Mandalorian seeks the now New Republic Marshal Cara Dune's help in breaking out the criminal Mayfeld to help track Gideon and rescue Grogu. Impressed with the Force powers Grogu exhibits against stormtroopers, Moff Gideon shows Grogu the Darksaber and has a stormtrooper stun and shackle him. After, Gideon informs Dr. Pershing that they have the donor.

			Prisoner Migs Mayfeld is working on the Karthon Chop Fields, and is remanded into the custody of Marshal Cara Dune. The Mandalorian needs Mayfeld, a former Imperial soldier, in order to acquire the coordinates to Moff Gideon's ship. Mayfeld directs them to a hidden Imperial rhydonium refinery on Morak. As all the others are known to Imperial security, the Mandalorian must accompany Mayfeld into the refinery to access a terminal and steal the coordinates. Mayfeld and the Mandalorian hijack one of the transports and disguise themselves as soldiers. The highly explosive rhydonium shipments are attacked by pirates, and the Mandalorian is almost overwhelmed fighting them off, two Imperial TIE fighters swoop in and kill the pirates, as they reach the facility, the only transport to survive.

			<br>

			The terminal Mayfeld needs is in the officer's mess hall, but Mayfeld sees his former commanding officer, Valin Hess, and fears being recognized. The Mandalorian goes instead but the terminal requires a facial scan, forcing him to remove his helmet and break the "Way of the Mandalorian" creed that he lives by to acquire the codes. He is confronted by Hess, but Mayfeld intervenes. After a tense drink where Hess callously dismisses the Imperial soldiers and civilians who died in Operation Cinder,[a] an angered Mayfeld shoots Hess dead. Mayfeld and the Mandalorian fight their way to the roof, while Fennec Shand and Dune provide covering fire, and Boba Fett arrives aboard Slave I. Mayfeld destroys the refinery with a well-placed sniper shot. The ship is pursued by two TIE fighters, but Fett obliterates them using a seismic charge. Dune lets Mayfeld go free as thanks for his aid, and the Mandalorian sends Moff Gideon a threatening message, vowing to rescue Grogu.

			The Mandalorian and Cara Dune board an Imperial shuttle and capture Dr. Pershing. The Mandalorian and Boba Fett visit Bo-Katan and Koska Reeves at a cantina, and after a scuffle between Fett and Reeves about the purity of the former's Mandalorian lineage,[a] they agree to help rescue Grogu in exchange for Bo-Katan getting the Darksaber from Gideon. Dr. Pershing warns the cruiser is defended by Dark Trooper droids. They use the shuttle to get close, as Fett pretends to attack them in Slave I, and they crash land in the TIE fighter launch tube. Bo-Katan, Koska, Fennec, and Dune fight through stormtroopers to the bridge.

			<br>

			Meanwhile, the Mandalorian finds the Dark Troopers and attempts to seal them off, although one breaks through. After a protracted struggle, he barely defeats it using his beskar spear and ejects the others out the airlock. He then enters the cell where Moff Gideon is standing by Grogu with the Darksaber extended. Gideon offers to let The Mandalorian take Grogu if he leaves the ship immediately, but Gideon strikes the Mandalorian when his back is turned. The Mandalorian fights Gideon with the beskar spear and overpowers the Moff, inadvertently making him the new rightful owner of the Darksaber. Upon delivering Gideon to the others on the ship's bridge, the Moff attempts to goad Bo-Katan into attacking the Mandalorian so she can rightfully claim the Darksaber and take the throne of Mandalore. The Dark Troopers return and close in upon the bridge, working to break through the blast doors. A single X-wing lands, the pilot of which is a Jedi Knight who engages and destroys all of the Dark Troopers. Gideon seizes an opportunity to kill Grogu but his blaster shot is blocked by The Mandalorian. Instead of dropping his weapon, Gideon tries to shoot himself but is disarmed by Cara Dune. The others object but The Mandalorian opens the blast doors to the Jedi, who reveals himself to be Luke Skywalker. Grogu hesitates to leave with Luke, until the Mandalorian gives his permission to go with the Jedi to complete his training. In an emotional farewell to Grogu, the Mandalorian removes his helmet and tearfully looks on as Luke, accompanied by R2-D2, departs with Grogu.
