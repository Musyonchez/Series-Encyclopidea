			Assane Diop plans the theft of a high-priced necklace from the Louvre, which his father was accused of stealing from the Pellegrini family 25 years earlier. He enlists the help of a group of loansharks to whom he owes money. Under the alias Paul Sernine, Assane attends the auction for the necklace and wins. The loan sharks double-cross him and steal the necklace, but their getaway goes awry and they are arrested. Assane ends up in possession of the necklace. While investigating the case, Youssef, a police lieutenant, notices it bears resemblance to the stories of Arsène Lupin, then realizes Paul Sernine and Arsène Lupin are anagrams of each other. Assane gives his son Raoul a copy of Arsène Lupin, Gentleman Burglar, given to him by his own father, who was framed for a previous theft of the same necklace and hanged himself in prison.

			Assane begins doubting his father's guilt and confronts Juliette Pellegrini. He gets himself placed in jail so he can speak to Étienne Comet, a man who worked at the prison library during his father's incarceration. A sickly Comet leads Assane to a copy of The Confessions of Arsène Lupin, with annotations from his father spelling out the phrase "I am innocent—trapped by Anne Pellegrini". Assane escapes prison and finds Anne, who admits to getting Assane's father to sign a false confession at the urging of an Inspector Gabriel Dumont, whom Assane recognizes as the policeman who turned him over to social services. Meanwhile, Youssef continues to investigate the Arsène Lupin connection, happening upon the file of Assane's father, Babakar Diop.

			After learning that Inspector Dumont was in charge of the case against his father, Assane kidnaps the now-Commissioner Dumont from City Hall and tries to extract a confession from him about his father's death. Flashing back 25 years, a younger Dumont expresses his doubts about Babakar's guilt. He starts to suspect Hubert Pellegrini, who had recently increased the necklace's insurance policy. Hubert, threatening Dumont's family, convinces him to trick Anne into getting Babakar to sign the confession. In the present, Assane accidentally reveals his identity to Dumont during the course of his interrogation. The police scramble to locate Dumont and Assane escapes just in time. Dumont is rescued but does not reveal any information about the incident. Youssef uncovers Dumont's involvement with the original investigation and connects them to the necklace's theft and the kidnapping.

			Assane finds Dumont again and coerces him into providing more information about Hubert Pellegrini. Dumont gives him the name of Fabienne Bériot, a disgraced former journalist who was blacklisted while investigating the Pellegrinis. Fabienne helps Assane acquire a tape connecting Hubert's arms dealing to a deadly terrorist attack on a French embassy in Kuala Lumpur. Assane anonymously posts an image from the tape on Twitter and threatens to release the video. Hubert denies the accusations, and his henchman Leonard starts stalking Fabienne. Meanwhile, Youssef is taken off the necklace investigation by Dumont, who realizes the police officer is coming closer to discovering the truth. Juliette Pellegrini, now convinced of her father's innocence, reveals to him that Assane is behind the accusations as well as the theft of the necklace. Leonard attacks Fabienne in her home and Assane later finds her body hanging from the ceiling.

			Following Fabienne's death, Assane finds himself pursued by Leonard as well. On Raoul's birthday, Assane gives him a Lupin costume and takes him and Claire on a train trip to a festival at Étretat. Leonard follows the family onto the train, with orders from Hubert to get rid of Assane but leave his family alone. Assane spots Leonard and manipulates the local police into arresting him as Paul Sernine. The family makes it to the festival without major incident, but Leonard is released from police custody and kidnaps Raoul on the beach. As Assane and Claire search desperately for Raoul, Youssef appears and calls out to Assane, addressing him quizzically as "Lupin".
