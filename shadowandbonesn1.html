			In East Ravka, Alina Starkov is a cartographer who is reunited with her childhood friend Mal Oretsev. Mal is chosen to be a part of the team who will cross the Fold, a dark place swarming with flying monsters named Volcra. Alina sabotages the maps and is allowed to join the crew. The team enters the Fold, overlooked by the arrival of General Kirigan, the Shadow Summoner. Shortly after entering the Fold, they are attacked by Volcra. Alexi, a crew member, escapes. Alina discovers her Sun Summoner abilities by unintentionally using them to fight off the Volcra in order to protect Mal. In Ketterdam, Kaz Brekker, Inej Ghafa, and Jesper Fahey compete with mob-boss Pekka Rollins for a job that pays one million kruge. When it is discovered that Dreesen first needs a Heartrender, Kaz beats Pekka to the only known one. Dreesen reveals to Kaz that he has captured Alexi. The Heartrender gets Alexi to reveal that Alina is a Sun Summoner, and Dreesen reveals that getting Alina is the job.

			In East Ravka, Alina is taken to Kirigan, who proves she is a Sun Summoner. She is then taken to the Little Palace. On her way, her convoy is ambushed by drüskelle, Grisha-hunters. Most of the Grisha are killed, but Kirigan rescues her. They make it to the Little Palace, where Alina is given a room. In Ketterdam, Kaz is threatened by Pekka to give him the job but he refuses. Inej is summoned by Tante Heleen, who runs the pleasure house she used to work at before Kaz bought her. Heleen promises to give Inej her freedom if she kills Arken, a human trafficker. Kaz discovers that a man called the Conductor is ferrying people across the Fold, then discovers that Arken is the Conductor and Tante wants him dead. Kaz stops Inej from killing Arken, then gives Tante his club as an acceptable collateral and promises to pay off his debt for Inej once he completes the job.

			Alina meets with a Tailor, Genya Safin, and they prepare for her meeting with King Pytor and the court. At court, Alina astonishes all with her abilities, which are amplified by Kirigan's touch. After befriending two Grisha, she spars with Zoya Nazyalensky, who beats her. In the library, Alina meets the Apparat, who tells her more of the stag she has been dreaming about. Alina then meets with the Baghra, who bitterly tells Alina to return when she believes in herself. Meanwhile Kaz, Jesper, Inej, and Arken are unable to get to Nina Zenik, a Heartrender willing to break them into the Little Palace, in time. Four pounds short of the needed coal, they dare to make the train voyage through the Fold. They fall behind schedule and are attacked by Volcra, but Jesper uses his superior marksmanship abilities to get them safely through. On a ship, the drüskelle who captured Nina restrain her along with other Grisha.

			Alina goes riding with Kirigan, who decides the two are on a first-name basis. He talks about how he felt like an outsider as a child due to being a descendant of the Black Heretic, and Alina realizes how much he needs her. Baghra shows Alina that she is holding back for Mal, but needs to focus on herself if she wants to master her powers. After another encounter with Kirigan, and still not receiving a letter from Mal, Alina finally puts herself and the Grisha first and makes true progress with her power. Meanwhile, Mal volunteers for a mission to find the stag that can amplify Grisha power, and the reward is a visit to the Little Palace. He and his team are ambushed by Fjerdans, but Mal survives. He then sees the Stag, and vows to reunite with Alina. The Crows and Arken steal the blueprints for the Little Palace, and join a troupe of traveling performers who will be performing in the Little Palace for the Winter Fete. The ship carrying Nina hits a bad storm. Kirigan sends Fedyor to find Nina, as she has not checked in recently.

			The Little Palace holds an event to show off Alina as the Sun Summoner. Kaz, Inej, Jesper, and Arken infiltrate the Palace to kidnap Alina. Mal, injured by Fjerdans, makes his way to a First Army camp. Here, he reveals that he has found the stag General Kirigan had been looking for. Mal, along with a First Army general, make their way to the Little Palace to pass the information on to Kirigan. The palace guard is initially reluctant to let Mal in, believing the Stag to be a myth, but gives in, and escorts Mal to Kirigan’s room. Kirigan asks Mal to show him exactly where he found the Stag. Mal, however, refuses, demanding to see Alina before he shows the General where he found the Stag. Kirigan is angry but eventually agrees to allow the two to meet later. Kirigan and Alina kiss after the event but are interrupted when Arken attacks a decoy, believing it to be Alina. Alina learns a secret about Kirigan and attempts to flee the Little Palace by climbing into the carriage of the Crows, who believe their mission has failed. Mal escapes the palace after being attacked by Baghra's accomplice. Baghra is revealed to be Kirigan's mother and doesn't want him to find the Stag.

			Arken is captured and interrogated after the attempt to kidnap Alina backfires, and he is killed by Kirigan. Alina climbs from the carriage but the Crows are unable to catch her. She is recognised as Shu by some townsfolk and is chased into a forest. She reunites with Mal and they both catch up. After learning about the Stag from Mal, Alina realises she must get to it before Kirigan, so she and Mal make their way North. The ship that is holding Nina Zenik sinks during a storm. She bonds with one of the surviving Grisha-hunters, Matthias, and the two become closer after Nina saves him from freezing to death with her powers.

			Alina and Mal find the Stag. Instead of killing it, Alina shares a moment with it before Kirigan shows up. He injures Mal and kills the Stag before having parts of its antlers imbued into Alina as well as his own hand. He shows Alina that he can now control her power and will take her to the Fold. He tells her he will heal Mal if she complies. At the campsite near the Fold, Genya reunites with Alina to get her ready for an event Kirigan is holding; he is going to take some nobles across the Fold and show them his and Alina's new found power. Kaz, Inej and Jesper find a way of getting on a ship to secure a way back home, after the train they took with Arken was blown up.

			Nina and Matthias safely reach a city but are confronted by Fedyor. To save his life, Nina declares Matthias a slave trader so that he is arrested instead of being captured by Feydor. Awakening imprisoned, Matthias wrongly believes Nina manipulated and betrayed him. As the ship crossing the Fold starts its journey, Alina uses her powers to shield it with a tunnel of light, protecting the passengers from the Volcra. However, when the ship reaches the other side, Kirigan expands the Fold towards West Ravka, overwhelming it and destroying a growing rebellion there. In the lower decks, Kaz and the others find Mal has snuck on board and they hatch a plan, but Mal rashly moves against Kirigan and is held at gunpoint, prompting the Crows to advance. Zoya, witnessing what Kirigan had done to West Ravka, turns against Kirigan and starts steering the ship across the Fold. Alina breaks free of Kirigan's control by cutting the antler from his hand and, with help from the Crows, defeats Kirigan's forces. Mal battles Kirigan but Kirigan is suddenly dragged away by a Volcra. Zoya, Alina and Mal, along with the Crows, leave the Fold, being the only survivors, and decide to go their separate ways. Kaz's gang meets Nina at the skiff headed back to Ketterdam. Alina goes with Mal on the skiff, as well, to continue learning how to use her powers. A wounded Kirigan emerges from the Fold.
