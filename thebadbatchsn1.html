			Before the end of the Clone Wars, while the Bad Batch—defective clones Hunter, Tech, Crosshair, and Wrecker plus cyborg clone Echo—are assisting Jedi Master Depa Billaba and her Padawan Caleb Dume on Kaller, Order 66 is issued and Billaba is killed by her clones. The Bad Batch receive the order too, but only Crosshair feels compelled to obey it, and Hunter lets Dume escape. Returning to Kamino, the Bad Batch learn that the war is over, that an Empire has replaced the Republic, and they meet a young girl, Omega, who is another defective clone. Admiral Tarkin arrives to evaluate the clones' viability, and sends the Bad Batch to eliminate a group of insurgents on Onderon. When they discover that these "insurgents" are actually fugitives under Saw Gerrera who refuse to submit to the new Empire, Hunter has his men abandon the mission and return for Omega. They are arrested for treason, and Tarkin has Crosshair's inhibitor chip enhanced, turning him against his squadmates and forcing the Bad Batch and Omega to flee without him.

			The Bad Batch and Omega seek refuge on Saleucami with clone deserter Cut Lawquane, who tells them about the inhibitor chips which programmed the regular clones and Crosshair to be loyal to the Empire after Order 66. With increased military presence from the Empire, Cut plans to escape with his family, but they discover that newly introduced chain codes are needed to book public transport. Knowing Cut would be arrested if he tried to get one, Tech and Echo steal some chain codes, and Omega helps deliver them to Cut and his family in time for them to board the transport. Hunter attempts to send Omega with Cut as he thinks she needs a family, but she decides to stay with the Bad Batch

			The Bad Batch and Omega are stranded on a moon after their ship was damaged on Saleucami, and an Ordo Moon Dragon steals the part they need to repair it. Hunter and Omega set out to retrieve it, but Hunter is incapacitated. Omega continues alone and is able to track the Dragon, retrieving the part without a fight. On Kamino, Tarkin and Admiral Rampart put Crosshair in command of a new unit of conscripted soldiers that are sent to Onderon to wipe out Gerrera's camp. Gerrera is already gone, and Crosshair kills one disloyal recruit, but the rest comply and are otherwise successful. Tarkin sees potential for conscripted soldiers, concerning Kaminoan Prime Minister Lama Su.

			On their way to a proposed hiding-place on planet Idaflor, the Bad Batch is forced to stop on the nearest planet, Pantora, so they can gather supplies and Tech can modify their ship's signature since it now appears on the Empire's wanted list. A landing bay attendant on Pantora identifies the Bad Batch and informs Fennec Shand, a mercenary who has been hired to retrieve Omega. Hunter, Echo, and Omega search for supplies while Tech and Wrecker work on the ship. Omega is approached by Shand, which leads to Hunter chasing Shand throughout the city. Hunter and Omega lose Shand, and, after the modifications are completed, the Bad Batch depart from Pantora.

			Hoping to discover who hired Shand, the Bad Batch go to Ord Mantell where Echo knows of a Jedi informant named Cid. She offers to find out about Shand in exchange for their help: slavers have kidnapped a child named Muchi, and Cid will receive a reward from Jabba the Hutt if the Bad Batch help her rescue the child. The Bad Batch find and fight off the slavers, rescuing Muchi, who is a young rancor. Taking her to Cid, Muchi is then given to Jabba's right-hand man Bib Fortuna in exchange for the reward. Cid gives some of the reward to Hunter but is unable to learn who hired Shand. She offers to give the Bad Batch more mercenary work in the future.

			Cid hires the Bad Batch to retrieve a Separatist tactical droid for its battle intel before it is destroyed at a Corellian decommissioning site. They encounter police droids guarding the facility, as well as Trace and Rafa Martez who are also after the droid. Wrecker accidentally hits his head and his inhibitor chip begins to activate. Tech and the sisters program the tactical droid to turn on the police droids, allowing them to escape, but the tactical droid is destroyed in the process. The sisters explain that they were retrieving it for a client who is fighting the Empire. Hunter gives them a copy of the droid's data that Tech made during the fight, and the sisters later tell their client how to find the Bad Batch.
